# MacOS-Theme
[ 12/26/18 ] C# Winform MacOS Theme, You put the cs file into your solution then drag either MacOSDarktheme, or MacOSLightTheme inside your solution. Currently it will only change the form. I will be adding buttons, progressbar, textbox, textlabels, and other stuff you will probably see on a theme.

# Themes
There is a Light theme, and a Dark theme. Both have the same traffic light buttons. I'm going to be working on a Blue theme and a Custom theme creator in the future.

# Licence 
You must credit the author (Absolutenothing), even if you're only using the buttons.
