# MacOS-Theme
[ 12/25/18 ] C# Winform MacOS Theme, this isn't a normal theme. Its just a compiled winform with the theme on it. I am working on the theme part, as of now this is what im thinking. If you want to change anything or add any new buttons you can put a commit ( don't really know how github works ) Anyways, i will release the theme on a later date.

# Themes
There is a Light theme, and a Dark theme. Both have the same traffic light buttons. I'm going to be working on a Blue theme and a Custom theme creator in the future.

# Licence 
You must credit the author (Absolutenothing), even if you're only using the buttons.
